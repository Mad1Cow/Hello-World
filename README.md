# Hello-World

Hi everybody!

Indie self-taught dev here trying to branch out my coding experience. Previously used C# with Unity game engine but want to branch out to learning java/HTML/SQL and hopefully become a software developer at some point.

Accepting any and all advice and criticisms. I want to get better no matter how hard the path.

-Sam
